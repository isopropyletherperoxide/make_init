# make_init
Creating GNU Make C projects with one command

This is an attempt at ``cargo init`` style project initialization for C projects.
(Because I cannot be bothered to memorize how to write Makefiles)

### Installation
Run ``make && sudo make install`` to build and install.

### Usage
Create project with ``make_init`` in your future project directory
